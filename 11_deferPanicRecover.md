# Defer, Panic & Recover in Go

Go provides three special statements: defer, panic, and recover, which are used for handling exceptional situations and resource management. This tutorial explores how to use defer, panic, and recover effectively in Go.

## Defer Statement

The `defer` statement schedules a function call to be executed after the surrounding function completes. It's often used for cleanup tasks like closing files or releasing resources. Here's an example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func first() {
    fmt.Println("1st")
}

func second() {
    fmt.Println("2nd")
}

func main() {
    defer second()
    first()
}
```

This program will print "1st" followed by "2nd". The `defer` statement moves the call to `second` to the end of the `main` function.

## Advantages of Defer

Using `defer` has several advantages:
1. It keeps the cleanup code (e.g., closing files) near the corresponding setup code, making it easier to understand.
2. Deferred functions are executed even if the function encounters a runtime panic.
3. Deferred functions are executed even if the function has multiple return statements.

## Panic & Recover

A panic is an exceptional situation in Go that indicates a runtime error or programmer mistake. It abruptly terminates the program. However, Go provides the `recover` function to handle panics gracefully.

Here's an example of using panic and recover:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    defer func() {
        if r := recover(); r != nil {
            fmt.Println("Recovered from panic:", r)
        }
    }()
    panic("PANIC")
}
```

In this example, the `recover` function is used in combination with `defer` to handle the panic gracefully. It stops the panic and returns the value that was passed to the call to `panic`.

## Conclusion

Defer, panic, and recover are powerful tools in Go for managing resources and handling exceptional situations. Understanding how to use them effectively is essential for writing robust and reliable Go programs.
